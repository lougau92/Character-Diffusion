# Character-Diffusion

This project is inspired by Scribblenauts Unlimited, https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scribblenauts#Gameplay_and_common_elements. This a scenario-based puzzling game where you have to desgin your optimal charcter based on the task to accomplish (e.g. if you want to free someone from prison, you can give the character a weapon, a tank, a knight...). The game contains a notebook that allows to use pre-defined prompts to sketch a character that then interacts with his surroundings to solve the task.

Even though the player has lots of options to design his character, his choices are limited. This projects aims at allowing that user to design his character with only constraint: is his own creativity ðŸ™‚.
